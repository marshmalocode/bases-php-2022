The alphabet is the set of 26 letters (from A to Z) that we use to represent English in writing:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
It is very important to understand that the letters of the alphabet do NOT always represent the same sounds of English.

This page is about how we pronounce the letters of the alphabet when we "say the alphabet (ABC...)". In our Writing section you can learn more about how we write the letters of the alphabet.

The English word "alphabet" comes from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha, beta
